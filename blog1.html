                So, this is the start of my tech blog for class. I'll be honest, I have almost no idea what to write for this.
                For now, I'll start with what I'm learning in my Programming 3 and Front End Web Dev classes. 
            </p>

                During the first week in class, we went over the basics of Object Oriented Programming, starting with creating instanced classes
                and using fields, constructors, properties, and methods. This week, we began learning about the pillars of Object Oriented Programming,
                beginning with encapsulation and its rules.  
            </P>

                In Front-End Web Dev, we started by setting up the tools we would be using in the class,
                such as Visual Studio Code and GitHub. We also went over how to do things on GitHub, like initializing a repository and 
                hosting a page as a GitHub site. This week, we started learning about more types of tags in Visual Studio Code, as well as tags for 
                lists and images.
