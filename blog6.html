    <p><h1>Midterms. Yay.</h1></p>
    <div>
        <p>
            Yay, the time that students around the world totally enjoy. That's right, it's time for
            midterm tests to start. As of right now, I've got midterms for Front End Web Dev, in the form of this blog,
            and Computer Programming 3, in the form of a bigger homework assignment. I don't think I have a midterm this week in my
            Financial Algebra class, but I think the professor mentioned something about an exam some time next week, so
            I can worry about that later.
        </p>
        <p>
            For Web Dev, I need to make a tech blog with minimum 6 posts, an "About Me" page,
            an index/home page, and links to my LinkedIn and portfolio (which may or may not be empty right now). I also need
            stylesheets, images, a navigation bar, all the things to make my blog look nice and easy to navigate. In all, 
            not too bad. We've been building up our blogs since the start of the quarter, so I have some stuff prepared already.
            I just need to try and make it look nice before the midterm is due.
        </p>
        <p>
            For Programming 3, I don't have to pay <em>as much</em> attention to how the UI looks, since what matters is that
            the code I write actually works. In this midterm, I have to basically create a super basic banking Windows Form. 
            I have to use a class library to create classes for customers, accounts, and addresses in addition to the actual
            form that the user interacts with. Again, not too bad as long as I paid attention to what we went over in class. Once
            the classes are set up, I just have to create methods to interact with the code. For example, one to deposit money and one
            to withdraw. Once I get that done, I just have to test and make sure nothing breaks on me. It's not a walk in the park,
            but at least it'll be over after Friday.
