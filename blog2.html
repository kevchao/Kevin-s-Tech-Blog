        <h1>Future Career</h1>
    </p>
    <div>
        <p>
            After the first blog post, I had no idea where to go with future posts. So, 
            I thought for this one I would go over my future career plans. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I'll be honest, I struggled to figure out what I would do for my career
            for years. As a kid, I would say all the usual kid answers when asked what I wanted to be.
            Things like firefighter, police officer, maybe superhero here and there. Once I got older and 
            more realistic, I managed to at least rule out some jobs that I wouldn't enjoy. Nowadays, 
            I've kind of set my sights on some sort of computer job. I'd be okay with being like a software developer,
            video game designer, pretty much anything involving making things I enjoy on computers.
            On that note, I have some friends in my friend group who are also pursuing computer-related careers,
            so we've joked around about potentially working together to make a game or something.
            Even if we only made a super basic game to share within our friend groups, I would be fine with that because
            we actually used our own skills to make something. Who knows, we might expand in the future and go bigger.
        </p>
        <p>
            If I don't end up developing games or software, I think another career path I could follow might lie
            in things like photo editing. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't need a degree to do it, since the main idea would
            be to just show my skill through my own edited pieces. I could be wrong though. I've already taken a 
            Visual Communications (VisCom) and graphic design class back in high school, so with what I learned on my own
            time, I think I more or less have the basics down. I wouldn't need too much motivation
            to edit photos either, since I sometimes edit photos from friends. If I don't pursue software or game development
            I might find myself a professional photoshopper, either as a full time job or just as a hobby, but most likely as a 
            hobby.
