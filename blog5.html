        <h1>Random Things I Learned About Minecraft</h1>

            This post was mostly inspired from a one-on-one check in I had with my 
            Front-End Web Dev teacher. The check in was mostly to discuss how I was doing in classes,
            as well as my future plans. At one point, the topic went to the coding languages of games such as Minecraft.
            Through this, I learned that Minecraft: Java Edition was coded in Java (kinda obvious when I think about it). 
            Through some quick Google searching, I found out that Bedrock Edition, the other version of Minecraft,
            was coded in C++. The education edition of Minecraft, which was was intended for school use, 
            was coded off the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition codebase. Something I found interesting was that 
            Java Edition seems to have issues with lag that Bedrock Edition doesn't have, apparently
            due to Bedrock being coded in an entirely different language.
