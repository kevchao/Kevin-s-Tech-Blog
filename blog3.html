        <h1>I Kind of Want a PC</h1>
    </p>
    <div class="body-paragraph">
        <p>
            Like the title says, I kind of want to build a PC to use for gaming and working.
            Back when I was just getting to know video games, I had a good time playing on my phone, on my iPad,
            consoles, whether it was a friend's or my own, and on school computers or my old computer. The games worked fine,
            but today, while I'm still okay with playing on said devices, there are a few issues here and there.
            Maybe sometimes the device can't run a certain game, or the game just isn't available on that platform.
            Whatever the case, these days, if you think about gaming, you maybe think about the cool and <em>very expensive</em>
            gaming rigs that the big YouTube or Twitch celebrities have. The setups that have like 3 monitors, a giant PC tower
            on the ground, lit up in every color of the rainbow.
        </p>

        <p>
            If I had one of those, that would be awesome, but again, they would be pretty expensive and definitely not in the price
            spectrum of a young college student. I don't have an urgent need for a new and shiny PC build right this minute, 
            but I plan to have my own some time in the future. Right now, I have a perfectly good laptop that I'm using, recommended 
            to me by a friend. I use it for basically everything nowadays and it works great. There are ups and downs, but 
            I'm happy with what I've got. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the future, I do definitely plan to build a PC for myself. Except for the fact that I know nothing about
            building a PC. Luckily for me though, I've got the pool of knowledge known as my friends and the internet.
            While I don't have exact parts in mind, I have some idea of what I want my PC to be able to do.
        </p>
        <p>
            First up, I'm definitely getting multiple monitors. There have been endless moments whenever I'm doing
            anything on my laptop and I don't have the space to fit 5 different windows and tabs all at once. Since this
            PC would be my main workstation, I would prefer to have a good amount of storage, since I definitely see myself
            downloading too many things. I'd also use it for gaming, so a decent processor and graphics card are also needed.
            Those are the main things, but I'll also things like a keyboard, mouse, headphones, and all the equipment 
            to customize the PC to my preferences.
